# Introduction
An in-depth analysis of a dataset on data professionals to offer insights and guidance for aspiring data nerds. This project explores the salaries of data professionals, the work/life balance, difficulty level, happiness level and workers' satisfaction.
# Background
This project was born from a desire to test my powerBI skills and a quest to choose the right data profession. The dataset was gotten from Alex the Analyst, and was selected because it was full of inconsistent entries, typographcal errors, among other issues, offering a unique opportunity to put my data cleaning skills to test and learn new ways of handling certain issues in a dataset.
# Tools I Used
For the in-depth analysis, I harnessed the power of the following tools
- **Power Query:** A data cleaning tool incorporated in PowerBI
- **DAX:** Data Analysis Expressison. A formula language used in PowerBI, Power Pivot, etc for calculations and creating custom measures.
- **Powerview:** An interface in PowerBI used for creating interactive and dynamic reports and dashboards.
# Data Cleaning Steps
- Columns were formatted properly and columns considered as unimportant for the project were removed.
- Some columns were trimmed and set to capitalize each word.
- Many values were replaced to fix inconsistent entries and spelling errors.
# Key Insights
## Salary Analysis

### Top Paying Roles
Managers and directors were the top paid, earning a median yearly salary of $162,500 and $141,500 respectively. This shows that organizations place a premium on skills like leadership, decision-making and oversight. This highlights the importance of acquiring both technical and soft skills. Their high earnings could also be as a result of their responsibilities and years of experience. AI software Engineers and Data Scientists were the third and fourth most paid roles respectively.
### Top Paying Industries
Defense and Transportation were the highest paying Industries with a median yearly salary of $116,000, followed by Biotech with a median yearly salary of $96,000, highlighting industries where data skills fetch the most consistent rewards.
### Top Paying Countries
Denmark was the highest paying country with data professionals earning a median yearly salary of $84,000, followed by Ireland and United States both with median yearly salaries of $76,000. Denmark has the highest pay but the high cost of living there and language barrier for non-Danish speakers makes it less attractive compared to other countries within the same salary bracket. Also, the dataset might underrepresent high paying roles and regions in the United States which dominates in the tech industry.
### Top Paying Skills
Python,  SQL and R have the highest salary ($188,000) for data professional and is ideal for those seeking skills that have the highest possible salaries. On the other hand, VBA has the highest median yearly salary ($106,000) followed by C#, QLIK Sense Script, SAS and Stata with a median yearly salary of $96,000. These skills are ideal for professionals looking for roles that consistently pay high salaries.
### Median Yearly Salary by Qualification
Data professionals with PhDs have the highest median yearly salary of $96,000, followed by those with masters and bachelors degrees, both having a median yearly salary of $53,000. High school graduates were the least paid with a median yearly salary of $20,000. This implies that higher levels of qualification generally attract high salaries among data professionals. Also, those with a masters and bachelors degree belong to the same pay bracket.
### Median Yearly Salary by Age
Data professionals between the ages of 55 - 61 were the highest paid, having a median yearly salary of $98,000. This could be as a result of their years of experience,  as this group of people are close to retirement and must have worked for a long period of time. Data professionals between 32 - 39 years were the second highest paid ($67,000) and were followed by those between 40 - 46 years old. Notably,  those between 18-24 years and above 62years were the least paid. This implies that data professionals just starting their careers and those at the end of their careers get paid the least.
## Work/Life Balance Analysis

### Average Work/Life Balance by Role
Database Administrators (DBA) and Directors have the highest average work/life balance (10.0) followed by Systems Configuration (9.0) and Managers with an average work/life balance of 7.0. This indicates that more specialized roles, top and mid level positions have a relatively higher flexibility than other roles among data professionals.
### Median Yearly Salary vs Work/Life Balance
There is no clear correlation between the median yearly salary and the average work/life balance. Notably, the optimal roles are managers and directors in this regard, having high salaries and high work/life balance.
### Average Work/Life Balance by Industries
Aerospace, Biotech and Professional Services have the highest work/life balance of 10.0 among industries,  followed by Consumer electronics and logistics and warehousing, both having an average work/life balance of 9.0.
### Average Work/Life Balance by Countries
Angola have the highest work/life balance (10.0), followed by Thailand, Uruguay and Vietnam, having an average work/life balance of 9.0 and Chile with 8.5.
### Average Work/Life Balance by Skills
SAS has the highest work/life balance of 8.0, this could be as a result of the predictability of its use, with task being well defined and automated. SAS is followed by Excel and Qlik Sense Script (7.0) and DAX 6.7. DAX having a lower work/life balance could be as a result of its steep learning curve and complexity.
## Career Switching Analysis

58.8% of the respondents switched to a data profession while 41.2% started their career in data.
### Top Roles for Career Switchers
An overwhelming majority of career switchers (244) switched to Data Analytics, 45 people were still either students or looking for a job and 21 switched to Data Engineering. Data analytics dominating in this regard could be as a result of it having a typically lower entry barrier than other roles.
### Top Industries for Career Switchers
The tech industry is the top destination for career switchers (this could be as a result of the ease of transition and higher salaries associated with tech roles), with 85 respondents switching to it, followed by finance and healthcare with 59 and 53 career switchers respectively.
## Difficulty Level Analysis
Most respondents (265) neither found it difficult or easy to break into data, 155 found it difficult,  130 found it easy, 44 found it very difficult and 27 found it very easy. This indicates that breaking into data is moderately difficult but achievable. Notably,  more career switchers (135) found it difficult and very difficult to break into data than non-career switchers(64).
A similar trend in difficulty levels was observed across industries, skills and roles
## Workers Satisfaction and Happiness Analysis

### Top reasons for Job Change
A better Salary is the top reason for employees to consider changing their job, followed by a good work/life balance and good culture tying with remote work. This implies that employee retention can be fostered by paying competitive salaries, improving work/life balance and fostering good culture at the place of work. Also, remote options should be made available if possible.
### Median Salary vs Happiness Level Based on Learning Opportunities
There is no clear relationship between the median salary and the happiness level based on learning opportunities.
### Learning Satisfaction by Industries
Aerospace, Biotech, Defense, Logistics and Warehousing and Poultry offered the highest learning opportunities. Data nerds looking to learn more on the job can consider these industries.
### Upward Mobility by Countries
Colombia has the highest upward mobility score (8.33), followed by Uzb and Vietnam with 8.0 and Chile and Philippines both having a score of 7.50.
### Learning Satisfaction by Skills
Altery offers the highest learning opportunities with a satisfaction score of 10.0, follow by Excel (6.75) and SAS (6.67).
# Conclusion
This project improved my PowerBI skills and provided valuable insights into data professions. The findings from the analysis serve as a guide for aspiring data professionals to choose a career path and for organizations to make changes that will foster workers retention and boost productivity. Aspiring data professionals can prioritize acquiring skills for roles and industries with high salaries, a good work/life balance, a low entry barrier and high workers' satisfaction. Those open to relocation can also migrate to countries with more favourable conditions.
